A huge throwback to Felicity. 

Pre-Felicity Fun
--------------------

Before my own Felicity, I was busy with the Felicity of the year prior. 
That entire Felicity can be summed up as following. (Names Redacted.)

* J! J!, he's our man, if he can't do it, no one can.
* Generic Portal
    * felicity_threads_base
* Felicity Is Fun
* [Laila](https://youtu.be/E-7qm4WeH9Q)
* M changed the IP
* Watashi Wa Happy!!
* scoreboard.py
    * ```SELECT user_nick, user_score FROM base_user JOIN contest_submission JOIN contest_question WHERE submission_state = 'AC' AND base_user.id = submission_user_id AND submission_question_id = contest_question.id AND (user_access_level = question_level OR user_access_level = question_level + 1) GROUP BY user_nick ORDER BY user_score DESC, user_access_level DESC, submission_timestamp ASC;```
* The ice cream which was promised, but never given.
* Rejudge :)
* ```celery -l info -A felicity_threads_base worker```
* HUP bhej
* SprinkleberryMuffin - 1.3.3.7
* hait10 - 1.0.1.0
* JibhA - 1.1.9.2
* ghost_rider - 0.7.7.7

* H, template me 404 haiku message ched mat!
* H, static bana na.
* is the scoreboard frozen
* Cheaters get a score of -12
* Dear portal makers and server admins and coordinators of Felicity '15, please keep in mind that there BC is not a pleasant thing to have in an international event. UG3 matters and all is nice, but don't forget that Felicity isn't UG3's. Whatever penalties you want to impose, please impose sensibly. From what I've heard, the code already has BC and you guys are fighting on the server and making more BC. I know it's not my place. But please. Get your shit together.
* Cache In - Question 48
* why are the servers in UTC

If that does not make any sense to you, don't worry. It's not meant to. 

Felicity Fun
