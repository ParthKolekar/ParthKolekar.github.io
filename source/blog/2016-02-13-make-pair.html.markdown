## Write-up

by [ParthKolekar](https://github.com/ParthKolekar)

As the question suggests, if you add the rainbow (R, G, B components of the image), and you 
get a couple (even pairity), then you are good to go, else you need one more (mark it odd pairity).

If you perform a pairity check over all the elements of this image, you will end up with a 3d vector
of even and odd pairities.

Print this out as an image, mapping both in different colors. You end up with the following image

This image is compressed for space. You can extract the orginal from the source image.

The flag is `shaktimaan`
