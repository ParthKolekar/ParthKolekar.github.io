## Write-up

by [ParthKolekar](https://github.com/ParthKolekar)

The question contains a link to an `image` which is not an image at all.
`file` command show that it is actually a wav file. 

The audio needs to be reversed and slowed down. You can then hear the 
Felicity Co-ordinator [polybuildr](https://github.com/polybuildr/) saying "the password is abracadabra". 

The password goes in reference to the Felicity '16 theme "Where magic happens".

The title is a tongue twister and hints that the content is audio.
